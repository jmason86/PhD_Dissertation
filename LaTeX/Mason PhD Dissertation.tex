\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

	Often the abstract will be long enough to require
	more than one page, in which case the macro
	``$\backslash$OnePageChapter'' should {\it not}
	be used.

	But this one isn't, so it should.

\dedication[Dedication]{
	To my late father, who inspired me from an early age to come this far.

\acknowledgements{	\OnePageChapter
	First and foremost, my deepest thanks to Tom Woods. Through the projects he's introduced me to -- in solar physics, in sounding rockets, and in small satellites -- I've discovered a career path that excites me and that provides continuous opportunities to learn and contribute. Moreover, he's an excellent role model: dedicated and passionate about his work, patient with everyone without seeming to have to try, and exceptionally reliable. All of the above combined has made my time in graduate school likely to be, upon reflection long from now, one of the highlights of my life. Thank you to my committee for guidance and support, most of whom I've been fortunate to work with closely: Xinlin Li, Scott Palo, Amir Caspi, and Jeff Forbes. Finally, I couldn't have struggled through without the support of my peers, especially Allison Youngblood, whose work ethic inspires me and whom I've been extremely lucky to find. Oh, and my dog, Nessie, who requires three walks a day, has turned out to provide the periods of relaxation away from a screen that have aided in my ability to actually comprehend the work I'm doing.
