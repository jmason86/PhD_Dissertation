\chapter{Mechanisms of Coronal Dimming}
\label{chaptermechanisms}



This chapter details the physics of coronal dimming. This first original contribution to the field shows that there are theoretically many physical processes that can lead to an uncareful observer identifying "dimming", which may have little to do with coronal mass ejection (CME). Traditionally, the term "coronal dimming" has been assumed to refer to the void left in the corona after a CME departs. This is one cause of a transient hole in the corona, and is of the greatest concern to space weather forecasters. Typically, a single dimming-sensitive wavelength or band will be observed and analyzed. However, changing temperatures, common during solar eruptive events, cause ionization fraction shifting, resulting in some emissions dimming while others brighten. Additionally, dark material (e.g., a filament) can pass between a bright region (e.g., flaring loops) and the observer, causing a transient dip in emission. Third, solar eruptive events sometimes have associated waves that propagate across the solar disk. These waves are observed as narrow bright fronts with a trailing dark region. The trailing dark region is another way to achieve a transient dimming of emission. Next, there are two ways that Doppler effects can cause transient dips in emission. The first is called Doppler dimming and results from fast moving plasma being sufficiently Doppler-shifted to reduce resonant fluorescence from the solar emission line sources; a phenomenon which is independent of the observation angle. The second occurs if eruptive plasma is moving fast enough in the line-of-sight to shift its emissions outside the bandpass of an observing instrument, which we have named "bandpass shift dimming". The physics, instrument effects, and mitigation strategies for each of these types of theoretically observable dimming are summarized in Table \ref{tablesummary} and are discussed in detail in the sections that follow.

    \begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|} \hline
	Short Name & Physical Process & EVE Observational Identifiers & AIA Observational Identifiers \\ \hline \hline
	Mass loss (Fig. \ref{figuremassloss}) & Ejection of emitting plasma from corona & Simultaneous intensity decrease in multiple coronal emission lines, with percentage decrease indicative of percentage mass lost & Area over and near the erupting active region (AR) darkens \\ \hline
	
	Thermal (Fig. \ref{figurethermal}) & Heating raises ionization states (e.g., a fraction of Fe IX becomes Fe X); cooling does the opposite & Heating: Emission loss in lines with lower peak formation temperatures and near simultaneous emission gain in lines with higher peak formation temperatures; vice versa for cooling & Heating: Area near AR darkens in channels with lower peak formation temperature and near simultaneous brightening in channels with higher peak formation temperatures; vice versa for cooling \\ \hline
	
	Obscuration (Fig. \ref{figureobscuration}) & Dim feature (e.g., filament material) moves into line-of-sight over a bright feature (e.g., flare arcade) & Drop of emission lines proportional to their absorption cross section in the obscuring material & Direct observation of this obscuration process \\ \hline
	
	Wave (Fig. \ref{figurewave}) & Wave disturbance propagates globally, causing compression/rarefaction of plasma as wave passes by & No effects have been identified & Direct observation of this wave process, especially apparent with difference movies \\ \hline
	
	Doppler & Fast moving plasma Doppler shifts away from resonant fluorescence with solar emission lines & Doppler wavelength shift of emission lines and change in intensity, possibly also observed as line broadening & Change in intensity of moving plasma as its velocity changes \\ \hline
	
	Bandpass & Emissions from fast moving plasma have Doppler wavelength shift & Emission line shifts in wavelength or has broadening & Doppler shift convolves with band-pass sensitivity to cause apparent reduction in emission \\ \hline

\section{Thermal Dimming}

In {\tt thesis} class (for Colorado University),
lists are defined so that nested lists will be
numbered or marked appropriately.
First, an itemized (non-enumerated) list
prefaces each item with a bullet.
Nested itemized list use asterisks,
then dashes, then dots.
These lists are typed between
the \verb2\begin{itemize}2
and \verb2\end{itemize}2
commands.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item A.
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item B.
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item C.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{} This is ``itemized'' subitem A.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubitem A.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubsubitem A.
      \end{itemize}
      \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubitem B.
    \end{itemize}
    \item{} This is ``itemized'' subitem B.
  \end{itemize}
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item D.
\end{itemize}

Enumerated lists use the commands
\verb2\begin{enumerate}2 and
\verb2\end{enumerate}2,
and nested enumerations appear like this.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item A.
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item B.
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item C.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subitem A.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubitem A.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubsubitem A.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubitem B.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subitem B.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item D.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{xfigDiagram} shows an image from a PDF file
imported into this document
using the \verb2graphicx2 package.
The command \verb2\usepackage{graphicx}2, which appears
near the very top of the main \LaTeX{} file, reads in
this package which defines the
\verb2\includegraphics{}2 macro.
