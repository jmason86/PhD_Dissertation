\chapter{Coronal Dimming Case Studies}
\label{chaptercasestudy}

% Mini-abstract
This chapter focuses on the detailed analysis of two coronal dimming events. One was selected for its relative simplicity, involving only mass-loss dimming and thermal dimming, while the other was selected for its complexity, involving nearly all of the types of dimming as described in Chapter \ref{chaptermechanisms}. The EUV irradiance and imaging observations of these events as well as the related coronagraph observations are first described in Section \ref{sec:observations}. A new method for deconvolving flare emission from dimming irradiance measurements is developed in Section \ref{sec:deconvolve} while Section \ref{sec:deconvolveerrors} contains the associated error propagation. Finally, Section \ref{sec:casestudyresults} provides analyses and results of these two coronal dimming events. We find that the new deconvolution method for irradiance successfully matches the dimming profile extracted from the spatially-isolated dimming as obtained from EUV image time series. Thus, we show that it is possible to accurately characterize dimming in a localized area even with no spatial resolution.

\subsection{Simple Dimming Case}
\label{sec:observationssimple}
This event occurred on 2010 August 7 at approximately 18:24 UT. The eruptive event consisted of an M1.0 flare, dimming in the region around the flare, and a coronal mass ejection (CME). Other active regions were also on disk but did not have any significant sympathetic responses. Mass-loss and thermal dimming were found to be important, while the other type of dimming (see Chapter \ref{chaptermechanisms}) were negligible.

The Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) LASCO CME catalog (herein referred to simply as the CDAW catalog) is an extensive database of all CMEs observed by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs with related quantities such as date, time, computed velocity, and sometimes mass \citep{Gopalswamy2009}. The CDAW catalog has seven CME events listed for 2010 August 7. All but two of them occur prior to the M1.0 flare at 18:24 UT that is of primary interest for the present study. The CME shown in Figure \ref{lasco2010aug7} is flagged as a halo event with a time of 18:36 UT in CDAW, while the next event occurred with a central position angle of 116\degree\ at 22:24 UT. The timing and location of the flare and associated dimming region suggest that the halo CME is associated with the dimming. The plane-of-sky velocity estimate for this CME is 871 $km\ s^{-1}$ as indicated in Figure \ref{lasco2010aug7}. No mass is listed for this CME in CDAW, but using LASCO and STEREO data and the techniques outlined in \citet{Colaninno2009}, a mass of $6.4 \times 10^{15}$ g was computed for this CME event (A. Vourlidas 2014, private communication). A true space velocity was also computed as 850 $km\ s^{-1}$ at 9 R\astrosun\ with a deceleration of 6.84 $m\ s^{-2}$ (Figure \ref{stereo2010aug7}). Based on these estimates for mass and velocity, this CME isconsidered be of modest size.

\paragraph{SDO/AIA EUV Image Observations}
The relative simplicity of this event is why it was chosen for a case study. The observations in AIA do not suggest that obscuration, waves, or Doppler shift contributed to the observed dimming. The area in the red contour of Figure \ref{aia2010aug7} was selected manually (by eye) to represent the region of mass loss, and its light curve shows clear dimming in 193 \AA\ and 171 \AA. In fact, the dimming from this region accounts for nearly all of the observed dimming throughout the entire event. This contour was selected after several iterations that indicated slight deviations in the contour had minimal impact on the light curve, as long as the dark region was fully encompassed. In other words, the result is fairly insensitive to the precise contour selection. The other contours were also selected manually to isolate regions of potential dimming e.g., as a sympathetic response from the solar eruptive event of interest. The exception is the magenta contour surrounding the flare loops that brightens dramatically but does not ever dim.

        dimming. The green contour outlines a filament, which also has the potential to sympathetically dim based on its 
        behavior during the M flare on 2010 August 5. The magenta contour isolates the flaring coronal loops. The white line 
        around the solar limb is an artifact of the solarsoft derotation method. Right three plots: light curves of AIA 171

        acts as a proxy for total dimming. All percent changes are calculated from the band’s value at 17:00 UT, prior to 
        the flare. The transition region He 304 \AA\ emission does not show dimming; both corona Fe emissions (171 \AA\ and 
        193 \AA) show dimming.

The He II 304 \AA light curves are included to provide a contrast to the dimming effects seen in the coronal Fe lines. This He II wavelength is generated primarily in the chromosphere and transition region, as opposed to the coronal source of the other wavelengths. Mass loss occurs primarily in the corona, as the term coronal mass ejection suggests. This is reflected in the lack of dimming observed in the non-coronal He II 304 \AA\ emission line.

\end{figure}
Thermal dimming may play a role in this event but may be difficult to quantify using only AIA because the relatively wide spectral bands of AIA channels mean many emission lines and any continua are blended together, which makes specifying a well-defined temperature difficult. Nevertheless, some indication of temperature is given by AIA and images that composite multiple wavelengths can aid in this analysis. Figure \ref{aiacomposite2010aug7} shows AIA composite images (211 \& 193 \& 171 \AA) before the solar eruptive event and during the dimming. All of these bands correspond primarily to the corona and transition region. If an area is dark, that means that there is little emission in all three of these wavelengths. Since these three bands span at least temperatures from 0.6-1.86 MK, that is indicative of mass loss. Even in areas of extreme heating, e.g., confined flare loops, it can be seen that emission is strong in all three of these bands resulting in the composite being white. Thus, it's unlikely that a region in these composite would become dark purely from a temperature change. EVE is less sensitive than AIA to blending in temperature space due to its higher spectral resolution and plethora of emission lines from Fe at different ionization states. A future study using the differential emission measure techniques of \citet{Caspi2014} to study the temperature evolution could help to quantify this effect.

\paragraph{SDO/EVE EUV Irradiance Observations}
Figure \ref{eve2010aug7} shows a trend that is consistent with the findings from Figure \ref{detectedDimmingVsIonization} -—that an ion’s peak formation temperature is inversely proportional to magnitude of dimming. The transition from an ionization state that shows dimming to ones that only show brightening occurs at Fe XIV 211 \AA, which itself shows dimming in some events but not others. The transition for where the Fe emission shows dimming is different for different solar eruptive events. For example, the Fe XVI 335 \AA\ emission has shown dimming for larger CME events \citep{Woods2011}. Herein, we will refer to Fe IX 171 \AA\ through Fe XIV 211 \AA\ as dimming lines for the 2010 August 7 event, and Fe XIV 211 \AA\ through Fe XXIV 192 \AA\ as nondimming lines (note that 211 \AA\ is included in both descriptions to reflect its ambiguity).

It is also interesting to note in Figure \ref{eve2010aug7} that the onset of dimming in the dimming lines is nearly simultaneous. The gradual-phase flare peak is delayed in lower ionizations of Fe, which is due to a cooling effect. The primary source of energy release in a flare is near the point of magnetic reconnection, typically far above the footpoints of the magnetic loops involved, in the corona. Some of the energy goes into the acceleration of particles downward. When these particles impact the denser chromosphere, they cause the heating and chromospheric evaporation. As that thermal plasma enters the corona it cools \citep{Fletcher2011}, and highly ionized Fe gains electrons. Thus, the peak is later for lower ionization states as seen in Figure \ref{eve2010aug7}. The Fe IX 171 \AA\ irradiance, in particular, shows the competing effects of this gradual phase flare peak and coronal dimming. Images with spatial resolution can isolate the flaring region responsible for this peak, as is shown with the magenta contour in Figure \ref{aia2010aug7}. Alternatively, we have developed a method for isolating and removing this peak in dimming lines with the spatially-integrated irradiance from EVE, which will be detailed in Section \ref{sec:deconvolve}.

\subsection{Complex Dimming Case}
This event occurred on 2011 August 4 at approximately 3:47 UT. It spawned from NOAA active region 11261 at location N19W36. The eruptive event consisted of an M9.3 flare, a large and fast CME, and nearly all of the types of dimming discussed in Chapter \ref{chaptermechanisms}: mass-loss and thermal dimming, a global wave that then triggered a sympathetic filament eruption, an obscuration dimming from the filament. This event was chosen specifically for presenting so many types of dimming and related physical processes in a single case. 

\paragraph{Coronagraph Observations}
The CDAW catalog for this event lists it as a halo CME with a velocity of 1315 $km\ s^{-1}$, relatively fast for a CME, and a mass of $1.16 \times 10^{16}\ g$. However, halo CMEs present a strong challenge for obtaining accurate mass, and the catalog flags it as a poor mass estimate. Mass estimates based on the three coronagraphs are $8.6 \times 10^{15}\ g$ for LASCO C3, $7-8 \times 10^{15}\ g$ for STEREO-A COR2, and $4.3 \times 10^{15}\ g$ for STEREO-B COR2 (A. Vourlidas 2013, private communication). A deprojected, 3-D analysis has not been performed for this CME. Images from the three coronagraphs are shown in Figure \ref{coronagraphs2011aug4}.

The CME in Figure \ref{coronagraphs2011aug4} (b) can be seen in STEREO-B (behind) on the right of the solar disk, in LASCO as the start of a halo CME offset to the upper-right of the disk, and in STEREO-A (ahead) on the left of the disk. Additionally, bright streamers can be seen inside the CME and on the opposite side of the Sun, signifying that the outer corona of the Sun was also in a more complex configuration than the 2010 August 7 case discussed in Section \ref{sec:observationssimple}. 

\paragraph{SDO/AIA EUV Image Observations}
The complexity this eruptive event are quite apparent in AIA observations. Figure \ref{aia2011aug4} is in the same format as Figure \ref{aia2010aug7} but is for the 2011 August 4 event. Dimming is seen in numerous locations for this event, indicating the far-reaching influence of this eruption. In particular, 193 \AA\ and 171 \AA\ show dimming in every region outside of the flare-isolating contour (yellow). The primary region thought to be associated with mass-loss dimming is labeled "core dimming" (orange) here. It corresponds to an area immediately surrounding the active region where the flare took place and is bounded by loops quiet-Sun on top and bottom and other active region's loops to the left and right. All other active regions visible on disk are contained in blue contours and eventually show even greater dimming than the core region (orange). Note that for the first several minutes, the core dimming dominates the other active regions. Note that the dotted black dash line is the disk signal excluding the flare region (yellow), or effectively the sum of all plotted lines except yellow. It can be seen that the relative contribution of each region to the total dimming is nonzero. Table \ref{tab:aia2011aug4} details these contributions.
